            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,368 texts created during Phase 1 of the project (2000-2009), initially available only to institutions that contributed to their creation, were released into the public domain on 1 January 2015. The approximately 40,000 texts produced during Phase 2 (2009- ), of which 34,963 had been released as of 2020, originally similarly restricted, were similarly freed from all restrictions on 1 August 2020. As of that date anyone is free to take and use these texts for any purpose (modify them, annotate them, distribute them, etc.). But we do respectfully request that due credit and attribution be given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

                  <head>A TESTIMONY And whole≈øome Advice concerning MARRIAGE.</head>
                  <p>MArriage is honourable in all, and the Bed undefiled, and it is Gods Ordinance, and is not to be forbidden, and whom God joins together no Man is to put a≈øunder; and this is the Marriage that hath a Ble≈ø≈øing, that minds Gods Joining, and Gods Ordinance; and the people of God were to practice it in all Ages, and the Faithful did ob≈øerve and do it: As <hi>Abraham,</hi> the Father and Pattern of the Faithful, charged his chief Servant to go to his own People, and take a Wife for his Son <hi>I≈øaac;</hi> and ≈øaid, the Lord God of Heaven and Earth ≈øhall ≈øend his Angel before thee; and his Servant (at Gods appointment) took <hi>Rebekah,</hi> and <hi>I≈øaac</hi> brought <hi>Rebekah</hi> to his Mothers Tent, and took her to Wife, <hi>Gen.</hi> 24. So here was Gods Ordinance and Gods Join<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing. And <hi>I≈øaac</hi> did not go contrary to God and his Fathers mind to take a Wife of the Daughters of <hi>Canaan,</hi> nor had a Prie≈øt to marry them; and <hi>I≈øaac</hi> was ble≈ø≈øed of God, and he gave him <hi>Jacob</hi> and <hi>E≈øau:</hi> And <hi>E≈øau</hi> de≈øpi≈øed his Birth right, and married of the Daughters of the <hi>Hittites,</hi> which grieved his Father and his Mother, <hi>Gen.</hi> 26. 35. So <hi>E≈øau</hi> went from Gods Joining, and grieved his Parents, and <hi>Rebekah</hi> ≈øaid to <hi>I≈øaac,</hi> if <hi>Jacob</hi> take a Wife of the Daughters of the Land, ≈øuch as the≈øe be, what good will my Life do me? <hi>Gen.</hi> 24. 46.
<pb n="2" facs="tcp:192062:4"/>
So here you may ≈øee the great care of <hi>Rebekah</hi> to pre≈øerve her Son from the Snare that <hi>E≈øau</hi> was come into, in this of Join<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing in Marriage with other People; and <hi>I≈øaac</hi> called his Son <hi>Jacob</hi> and charged him, and ≈øaid, thou ≈øhalt not take a Wife of the Daughters of <hi>Canaan,</hi> but ≈øhalt go to thy Mothers Kin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred, and God Almighty ble≈øs thee and pro≈øper thee, <hi>Gen.</hi> 28. And <hi>Jacob</hi> obeyed his Father and his Mother; and the Lord appeared to him in his Journey and ble≈ø≈øed him, and ≈øaid I will greatly multiply thee, and will be with thee: And <hi>Jacob</hi> ≈øaid if God will ble≈øs me and pro≈øper me in the way that I go, and bring me to my Fathers hou≈øe in Peace, then ≈øhall the Lord be my God, <hi>ver≈ø.</hi> 21. So here you may ≈øee <hi>Jacob</hi> minds the Lord, and obeyed his Parents in his choo≈øing a Wife; and the Lord ble≈ø≈øed him abundantly. And the Sons of <hi>Jacob</hi> could not ≈øuffer their Si≈øter to marry with a Stranger though he was a great Prince. And the <hi>Jews</hi> which were the Off-≈øpring of <hi>Abra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ham, I≈øaac,</hi> and <hi>Jacob,</hi> were not to join in Marriage with other People; as it is written, thou ≈øhalt not take their Daughters to thy Sons, nor give thy Daughters to their Sons; for they will turn your Hearts from the Lord after other Gods, <hi>Deut.</hi> 7. 3. <hi>Jo≈ø.</hi> 13. 12. So here you may ≈øee, according to Gods Ordinance, there is a power in Parents in giving their Daugh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters in Marriage, and in taking Daughters to their Sons; they have a part in their Children to give and take in ca≈øe of Marriage. And when the <hi>Jews</hi> did mix in Marriage with other People, they corrupted them, and drew them from God, and kindled his Anger again≈øt them, as you may ≈øee, <hi>Numb.</hi> 25. where the young men took the Daughters of <hi>Moab,</hi> which kindled Gods anger, and many of them died, and a great breach was made till <hi>Phinehas</hi> ≈øtood in the Gap, and ≈øtopped tho≈øe proceedings, and turned away Gods Wrath; and the≈øe went from Gods Ordinance and from Gods Joining, and went from the good example of their Fathers, <hi>Abraham, I≈øaac</hi> and
<pb n="3" facs="tcp:192062:4"/>
                     <hi>Jacob.</hi> And you may ≈øee that <hi>Solomon</hi> a wi≈øe King, his ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king of Strangers turned his Heart to wor≈øhip Idols, for which the Lord rent the Kingdom from him, only left him a Lamp in <hi>I≈ørael</hi> for <hi>David</hi> his Fathers ≈øake: And you may ≈øee in all the Pa≈ø≈øages of the <hi>Jews</hi> revolting from God, for the mo≈øt part, the chief rea≈øon was their matching in Marriage with other People, as in <hi>Nehemiah</hi> and <hi>Ezra,</hi> where you may ≈øee the <hi>Jews</hi> had taken Strangers of the Daughters of <hi>A≈øhdod,</hi> which grieved the Lord and his Servants <hi>Ezra</hi> and <hi>Nehemiah:</hi> So here you ≈øee they went from Gods Ordinance and Gods Joyning. And the Apo≈øtle ≈øaith to the Church, be not une<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>qually yoked, a Believer with an Unbeliever, he accounts it as Light and Darkne≈øs, as Chri≈øt and Belial, as the Temple of God and Idols, 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 6. for Believers in the Light of Chri≈øt Je≈øus are the Called of God, and the Seed of <hi>Abraham,</hi> and the Temple of God, and his Sons and Daughters, and are Heirs of the Promi≈øe in the New Covenant, and are <hi>Jews</hi> in Spirit, and have the Circumci≈øion of the Spirit made with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out Hands, and are under the Law of the New Covenant which God hath written in their Hearts; and ≈øuch cannot Join to give or take in Marriage, with any Sect or ≈øort of Per≈øons or People that believe not in the Light of Chri≈øt Je<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øus, with which he hath enlightned every Man that comes into the World; nor believe not in the Grace of God, but turn it into Wantonne≈øs; nor in the Law of the New Cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant which is written in the Heart according to Gods Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mi≈øe: And do not wor≈øhip God in Spirit, but in ≈øome form, without the Power of God; neither have received the Cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumci≈øion of the Spirit to circumci≈øe their Hearts and Ears, ≈øuch the Seed of <hi>Abraham</hi> mu≈øt not Join with in Affinity of Marriage, nor take their Daughters to their Sons, nor give their Daughters to their Sons; for you ≈øee it is contrary to Gods Ordinance, and contrary to the Spirit of <hi>Abraham,</hi>
                     <pb n="4" facs="tcp:192062:5"/>
                     <hi>I≈øaac</hi> and <hi>Jacob,</hi> which were great Fathers and Patterns; and all the true Believers in Chri≈øt Je≈øus are to follow their ≈øteps in the New Covenant, and will charge their Sons and Daugh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters that they joyn not in Marriage with any, but among≈øt their own People, that are Wor≈øhipers of God in Spirit, and Children of ≈øuch Believers as be of Faith and Society with them, in the Wor≈øhip and Service of God; and ≈øuch Chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren as fear God, and are reverent and obedient to Parents, which all are obliged to by the Law of the fir≈øt Covenant, and by the Law of Chri≈øt Je≈øus, and by the Doctrine of the Apo≈øtles; I ≈øay ≈øuch Children will keep their Parents Charge as <hi>I≈øaac</hi> and <hi>Jacob</hi> did, and not grieve and vex their Parents as <hi>E≈øau</hi> did his Father and his Mother, in marrying with the Daughters of Strangers: for ≈øuch Parents as are of <hi>I≈øaac</hi> and <hi>Rebekah</hi>'s Spirit are much concerned in this Ca≈øe, and cannot but grieve when their Children joyn in Marriage with ≈øuch as are before mentioned, and give away their believing Parents part that they have in them, to the World; which makes Confu≈øion, and grieves God's good Spirit, and ≈ømites their Parents with Grief, and ≈øuch as ≈ømote Father and Mother in the time of the Law were to die, <hi>Exod.</hi> 21. 15. for Parents have a great Power and part in their Children, as in <hi>Numb.</hi> 30. 3, 4, 5. If a Daughter in her Fathers Hou≈øe unmarried make a Vow or Promi≈øe, her Father hath power to break it or e≈øtab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>li≈øh it: and you may ≈øee, 1 <hi>Sam.</hi> 2. 3. &amp; <hi>chap.</hi> old <hi>Eli</hi> did not u≈øe his Power to re≈øtrain his two Sons from their Wickedne≈øs, for which the Lord cut off the Arm of <hi>Eli,</hi> cut off his Fami<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly from the Prie≈øthood; and Believers are a Royal Prie≈øthood to offer to God ≈øpiritual Sacrifices. So they are to u≈øe their utmo≈øt Endeavours to re≈øtrain their Children from running into the World, which lies in Wickedne≈øs; or into their Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øhions or Familiarity, which often doth great hurt, as <hi>Jacob</hi>'s Daughter, in vi≈øiting the Daughters of the Land of <hi>Canaan,</hi>
                     <pb facs="tcp:192062:5"/>
was defiled: So Friends are to be careful to watch over their Children, for their pre≈øervation from tho≈øe things which Youth is prone to fall into to their great hurt; for we were but a few at the fir≈øt when God called and cho≈øe us to be his People; and now there is a young Generation ≈øprung up of young Men and Women, many of them ≈øprung from the Loins of true Believers, and many of them runs into the Pride and Fa≈øhions of the World, and take Wives and Husbands of the World, and go to the Teachers of the World to be mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ried; and ≈øo go from Gods Ordinance and Gods Joining: And men of the World ≈øee that Friends are a thriving People in their outward Sub≈øtance, which makes them ≈øeek after Friends Children to marry with them: And ≈øome Friends, when their Rebellious Children have ≈øo done, (through Indul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gence and Affection to their Children, more than the publick good) have given them Portions: And this encourageth the World to ≈øeek Friends Children in Marriage, and encourageth wanton Children to con≈øent to them, by which means a breach is made upon our Youth, to the wounding and grieving the Spirits of the Faithful that are <hi>Abrahams</hi> Children, and are of the ≈øame mind with <hi>I≈øaac</hi> and <hi>Rebekah,</hi> and cannot give their Children in marriage to other People upon any account: But are willing to give their Children the ≈øame liberty as the Elders of <hi>I≈ørael</hi> did to the Daughters of <hi>Zelophehad,</hi> who might marry to whom they plea≈øed in their own Tribe. So Friends mu≈øt u≈øe their godly endeavours, according to the ut<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mo≈øt of their Power, to ≈øtop the gap of ≈øuch proceedings that their Arm be not cut off as old <hi>Eli</hi>'s was. And you may ≈øee before the Flood, when the Sons of God married with the Daughters of Men, how it grieved God. And is it not all one when Friends marry with other People, and ≈øome Friends Children are ≈øurprized and hurt and ≈øpoiled, their Parents al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowing them to go into the Finery and Fa≈øhions of the World,

                                 <hi>Fir≈øt,</hi> That all Parents, both Men and Women, take care to educate their Children in the awe and fear of the Lord, according to the Principles of the ble≈ø≈øed Truth, taking care to re≈øtrain them from ≈øuch Company and Acquaintance that may allure them from the way of Truth, into the Vanity of the World; and likewi≈øe to re≈øtrain them in any other things that may have a tendency to draw their Minds from the fear of the Lord, and from the ≈øence of his ble≈ø≈øed Truth: That ≈øo through the ≈øence of the Truth in them≈øelves, it may ≈øo ballance their natural Affections, that they may rightly ≈øee the ≈øtates and conditions of their Children, as to give that whol≈øome Advice and Coun≈øel that may an≈øwer the Wit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ne≈øs of God in them.</p>
                              <p>
                                 <hi>Secondly,</hi> If any Friends do perceive that their Children are under ≈øuch a Temptation, as to go to a Prie≈øt to be married, or to take one of the World to Husband or Wife; if they will not hear that coun≈øel and advice, which in the fear of the Lord they give them; then let them inform Friends, that they may deal with them in the order of the Go≈øpel, that ≈øo, if po≈ø≈øible, they may be pre≈øer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved out of the ≈ønare, or the greater weight of Judgment may be laid on them by their Parents in particular, and Friends in general.</p>

Portion, until ≈øuch time they be reconciled to Truth and Friends as afore≈øaid; for the withholding that may be in≈øtrumental to cau≈øe them to enter into a con≈øideration of their Di≈øobedience to the Lord and their Parents, from whence true Repentance may ≈øpring, and not only ≈øo, but it may be an occa≈øion to prevent others from falling into the ≈øame Snare, and may put a ≈øtop to ≈øome of the World in ≈øeeking after our Children on that account.</p>

                                 <hi>Fourthly,</hi> We do de≈øire that Friends in every place will have ≈øuch a watchful Eye over one another in the fear of the Lord, that if they ≈øee any Parents negligent in their duty, by too much in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dulging their Children in tho≈øe things that Truth doth not allow, that they admoni≈øh them of it in the Love of God, and Sence of Truth, that ≈øo things may be kept well among≈øt us.</p>

                                 <hi>Fifthly,</hi> As in the weighty Sence of the ble≈ø≈øed Truth we have given our advice and coun≈øel in this particular. So in the ≈øame Sence we advi≈øe and coun≈øel Friends in the general, that in all things they walk as becomes the Go≈øpel, taking heed that in no re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øpect they give way to any liberty which the Truth doth not allow of; for that is ≈øo far from the true Chri≈øtian liberty that it hath a tendency to imbondage the Soul again, as the Apo≈øtle ≈øaid, <hi>Hold fa≈øt the Liberty wherewith Chri≈øt hath made you Free, and be no more entangled with the Yoak of Bondage.</hi> And as the Lord hath ≈øet Limits and Bounds in his Truth, our pre≈øer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation doth con≈øi≈øt in keeping within the bounds of it; in which we may expect the Ble≈ø≈øings and Mercies of the Lord to re≈øt upon us, and to be multiplied unto us and our Children, to the Prai≈øe of his Name for ever.</p>
